Weatherly App

A Weather app that uses WeatherAPI.com Api to retrieve the current weather for the queried city.

Set Up:

To retrieve the current weather snapshot for the queried city, simply search for the city in the textfield at the top of the screen; the app will retrieve and display the current weather including:

- Temperature
- Weather Conditons
- Humidity
- UV Index
- Feels like Temperature

The queried city is saved in between app sessions allowing for the weather api to be called automatically on the app's launch.

In the event the queried city is incorrect the user is prompted to retry their selection.
